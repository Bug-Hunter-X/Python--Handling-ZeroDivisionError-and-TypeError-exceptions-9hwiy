# Python: Handling ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions

This repository demonstrates a Python function that handles both ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` takes two arguments, and it returns different values based on input types. This showcases a practical aspect of Python's exception handling capabilities, showing flexibility for handling multiple error scenarios within a single function.

## Usage:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `bug.py` to see the function's behaviour for different inputs.
3.  Observe the exception handling of both ZeroDivisionError and TypeError within the program.
